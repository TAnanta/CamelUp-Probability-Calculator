A basic calculator for determining which of the 5 camels will be leading the leg. Currently, works well for the initial legs, but I haven't added the logic yet for when camels overflow past space 16.
There is also no support yet for spectator tiles influencing movement, as well as no crazy camels yet.

I will hopefully be adding them in the future.
